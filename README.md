# Page-Replacement-Algorithms-GUI

This repository focuses on updates on the code files for the Page-Replacement-Algorithm-GUI
Page Replacement Algorithm is one of the most important topic in the subject of Operating System. The working of the Operating System is incomplete without the impolementation of Page Replacement Algorithm.

I with my 4 team members have created this project of creating a Desktop App for **Visualization of Page Replacement Algorithm** written solely in Java Programming Language. This project is a part of Virtual Lab construction for the subject of Operating System by my university i.e. Pandit Deendayal Energy University, Gandhinagar, Gujarat,India under the supervision of CSE Department of the college.
For the construction of GUI/Desktop App we have used 7 major libraries for the proper functionality of the project. The 7 major libraries used are as follows:
1. Javax **Swing Package** for the creation of desktop application
2. Java **Lang** for Exception Handling
3. Java **AWT** for designing and drawing of various elements and for creative look of the desktop
4. Java **Lang Thread class** to change between multiple JFrames smoothly and effortlessly.
5. Used **JFreeChart library**, which is an external jar file to show graph and comparisons graph.
6. Used **vlcj library**, which is an external jar file to attach the video animation and the voice over created by the team.
7. Javax **Windows Builder method** to create the visuals in the GUI

Attaching the whole project implementation readme file and pdf with this description to help you compile and run the code efficiently on you machine :-
